/**
 * Implementors are notified of a file roll after the roll is complete. A
 * typical use may be, for example, to call
 * {@link FileRollEvent#dispatchToAppender(org.apache.log4j.spi.LoggingEvent)}
 * to append a custom logging event directly to the new log file. Alternatively,
 * the {@link FileRollEvent} makes available the source {@link org.apache.log4j.Appender}, making
 * possible, for example,
 * {@link org.apache.log4j.Appender#doAppend(org.apache.log4j.spi.LoggingEvent)} in order to
 * trigger a {@link org.apache.log4j.spi.Filter}, or perhaps to log more highly customised messages.
